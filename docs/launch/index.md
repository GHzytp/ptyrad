# Launch PtyRAD

You can launch *PtyRAD* with many different approaches once it's installed in your Python environment.

For example, you can:
1. Run the demo Jupyter notebooks under `ptyrad/demo/scripts/`
2. Launch with CLI tools from your terminal as simple as `ptyrad run --params_path <FILE_PATH>`
3. Use a Slurm job script like `ptyrad/scripts/slurm_run_ptyrad.sub`

For all the launching method, *PtyRAD* supports 2 operation modes:
- reconstruction
- hypertune (hyperparameter tuning)

These operation modes can be executed on CPU, GPU, or even distributed on multiple GPUs for better performance.

**Routine workflow**
1. Acquire experimental or get simulated data
2. Prepare params files
3. Launch *PtyRAD* task
4. Analyze and refine the params file
