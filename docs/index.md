# Welcome to PtyRAD

*PtyRAD* performs ptychographic reconstruction using an [automatic differention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation) (AD) framework powered by [*PyTorch*](https://pytorch.org/), which enables flexible and efficient implementation of gradient descent optimization. See our [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07814) and the [Zenodo record](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15273176) for more information and demo datasets.
