# constraint_params

`constraint_params` determines the individual iter-wise constraints for the CombinedConstraint used for PtyRAD reconstruction
Generally, these constraint functions are applied after each (or a couple) iteration(s) to stabilize the optimization trajectories
When applied, the target tensor is passed through the constraint function, and the tensor get directly modified by the constraint function
Set 'freq' to a positive integer to specify how often do we want to apply such constraint. For example, 'freq' = 1 would apply the constraint after every iteration, and setting 'freq' to null would disable that constraint. 
Most constraints are designed specifically for an optimizable tensor to make sure they're following some arbitrary preference
In other words, we typically choose the constraints according to our optimizable tensors. 
For example, we need 'ortho_pmode' if we're optimizing mixed-state probe. Similarly, we need either 'obj_zblur' or 'kz_filter' to stabilize the multislice ptychography reconstruciton along z-direction.
A common combination of constrains for mixed-state probe multislice ptychography would be 'ortho_pmode', 'fix_probe_int', 'kz_filter', and 'objp_postiv'

```yaml
constraint_params : {
    'ortho_pmode'   : {'freq': 1}, # Apply a SVD decomposition and orthogonalization of the mixed-state probe similar to the PtychoShelves implementation (except it's vectorized in PtyRAD). Turn this on when optimizing with mixed-state probe
    'probe_mask_k'  : {'freq': null, 'radius': 0.22, 'width': 0.05, 'power_thresh': 0.95}, # Apply a k-space sigmoid (similar to a top-hat) probe mask that cut off spatial frequencies beyond the probe-forming aperture. This prevents the probe from absorbing the object structure in k-space. It might cause high-frequency oscillations in the real-space object if you have strong diffuse background in the diffraction pattern and did not provide mixed-object to properly reproduce it. Recommend setting it to 'null' unless you're pursuing mixed-object with more physical probes. k-radius should be larger than 2*rbf/Npix to avoid cutting out the BF disk. 'radius' and 'width' are used to define the sigmoid funciton in relative unit with kMax. See 'utils/make_sigmoid_mask' for more details. 'power_thresh' is used to specify how far into the pmode should be masked. If 'power_thresh': 0.95, the k-space mask would be applied from strongest probe modes to the one that adds uo to 95% total intensity. This promotes a more physical mixed-probe while keeping a small fraction of probe modes to absorb unexpected errors.
    'fix_probe_int' : {'freq': 1}, # Rescale the probe intensity to make it consistent with the total diffraction pattern intensity (so every probe electron hits on the detector). This is needed to stabilize the object amplitude update because the probe update could potentially change the total intensity. This removes the scaling constant ambiguity between probe and object, and should be applied if you're simultaneously optimizing the probe and object amplitude
    'obj_rblur'     : {'freq': 1, 'obj_type': 'both', 'kernel_size': 5, 'std': 0.5}, # Apply a "lateral" 2D Gaussian blur to the object. This removes some high frequency noise in the reconstructed object and make the apperance smoother. 'obj_type' can be either 'amplitude', 'phase', or 'both' with a specified 'std' and 'kernel_size' in unit of real-space px. Ideally kernel size is odd (like 5) and larger than 6std+1 so it decays to 0. This is usually not needed if your dataset contains sufficient dose and the kMax is not insanely high (extremely high kMax would gives very fine dx which makes feature appear sharper and probably more seemingly noisy)
    'obj_zblur'     : {'freq': 1, 'obj_type': 'both', 'kernel_size': 5, 'std': 1}, # Apply a "z-direction" 1D Gaussian blur to the object. This is a real-space alternative to the typical kz_filter (or so called missing-wedge regularization that applies Fourier filtering to the object) designed for multislice ptychography. Similar to 'obj_rblur', 'obj_type' can be either 'amplitude', 'phase', or 'both' with a specified 'std' and 'kernel_size' in unit of real-space px. Note that the 'ptycho/engines/GPU_MS/private/regulation_multilayers.m' from PtychoShelves (fold_slice) is a combination of 'obja_thresh', 'kr_filter', and 'kz_filter', so you may want to activate all these constraints altogether in PtyRAD to get the most similar effect 
    'kr_filter'     : {'freq': null, 'obj_type': 'both', 'radius': 0.15, 'width': 0.05}, # Apply a "lateral" Fourier low-pass filtering to the object. This is similar to the band-pass filter in Digital Micrograph that the k-space filter has a sigmoid-like profile, essentially a cut-off spatial frequency. Typically we're reconstucting object all the way to kMax (Nyquist frequency) so there's not much room for us to filter out hence it's recommended to keep this off unless you want to exclude certain spatial frequencies. 'radius' and 'width' are used to define the sigmoid funciton in relative unit with kMax. See 'utils/make_sigmoid_mask' for more details
    'kz_filter'     : {'freq': null, 'obj_type': 'both', 'beta': 1, 'alpha': 1}, # Apply the arctan kz filter just like the 'regulation_multilayers.m' in PtychoShelves. 'beta' controls the strength of the arctan function and is the same as 'eng. regularize_layers' in PtychoShelves. Typical value of 'beta' ranges from 0 to 1. 'alpha' is the implicit constant controls the lateral Fourier filtering that has similar effect as 'kr_filter', usually set as 1 to be consistent with PtychoShelves. Note that 'kz_filter' is designed to be a PtyRAD equivalence of the 'regulation_multilayers.m' so it also includes the arctan Fourier filer, lateral Fourier filter, and the soft object amplitude thresholding if you set 'obj_type' to 'both'. See 'optimization/kz_filter' for more details. While this 'kz_filter' works very well for most multislice reconstructions of crystals, you might prefer 'obj_zblur' if you have an object that has distinct top and bottom layer like twisted bilayer or tilted systems because 'kz_filter' would introduce intermixing between the top and bottom layer due to the periodic boundary condition of Fourier transform. Another solution to the intermixing is to pad vacuum layers to your object and remove them later, although padding extensive vacuum layers tend to make object phase bleed into the vacuum layers and it's very hard to set the interface
    'complex_ratio' : {'freq': null, 'obj_type': 'both', 'alpha1': 1, 'alpha2': 0}, # Apply a complex constraint between object amplitude and phase based on https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2024.114068 and https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.18.001981. This will constrain the amplitude to as A' = exp(-C*phase), C is an estimated (adaptive) positive constant, so the amplitude would look similar to phase and strongest phase shift would correspond to less than 1 amplitude. Default value of phase object is alpha1 = 1, alpha2 = 0. Note that the implementation considers the negative correlation between amplitude and phase for electctron ptychography, hence it's not the exact same formula as in the papers.
    'mirrored_amp'  : {'freq': 1, 'relax': 0.1, 'scale': 0.03, 'power': 4}, # Apply a more flexible, ad hoc constraint for constraining amplitude using 1-scale*phase**power, which provide more arbitrary parameters to tune the constrained amplitude based on the phase.
    'obja_thresh'   : {'freq': 1, 'relax': 0, 'thresh': [0.98, 1.02]}, # Apply a thresholding of object amplitude around 1. The threshold is defined by 'thresh' and the value is determined by the min and max. Note that wave amplitude is multiplicative when propagating through multislice object, so even an objective amplitude of 0.95 can become 0.6 after 10 layers. The thresholding can be relaxed by the `relax` param that is a weighted sum betwen the pre-threshold and post-threshold values.
    'objp_postiv'   : {'freq': 1,    'relax': 0}, # Apply a positivity constraint of the object phase, make it non-negative. This clips the negative values (anything below 0) so the object is visually darker but with stronger constrast, it's suggested to keep it on so that you can interpret, compare, and process your object phase with a simple baseline. Besides, the positivity constraint makes it easier to compare with atomic potential ground truth after correct scaling for the scattering factor. The clipping can be relaxed by the `relax` param that is a weighted sum betwen the pre-threshold and post-threshold values.
    'tilt_smooth'   : {'freq': null, 'std': 2} # Apply a lateral Gaussian blur of the local object tilts in unit of "scan positions". This smoothens the local tilts so that you don't have drastic changes of object tilts between scan positions.
