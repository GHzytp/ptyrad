    "    'NITER': 20, # type: int. Total number of reconstruction iterations. 1 iteration means a full pass of all selected diffraction patterns. Usually 20-50 iterations can get 90% of the work done with a proper learning rate between 1e-3 to 1e-4. For faster trials in hypertune mode, set 'NITER' to a smaller number than your typical reconstruction to save time. Usually 10-20 iterations are enough for the hypertune parameters to show their relative performance. \n",
    "    'BATCH_SIZE': 16, # type: int. Number of diffraction patterns processed simultaneously to get the gradient update. \"Batch size\" is commonly used in machine learning community, while it's called \"grouping\" in PtychoShelves. Batch size has an effect on both convergence speed and final quality, usually smaller batch size leads to better final quality for iterative gradient descent, but smaller batch size would also lead to longer computation time per iteration because the GPU isn't as utilized as large batch sizes (due to less GPU parallelism). Generally batch size of 32 to 128 is used, although certain algorithms (like ePIE) would prefer a large batch size that is equal to the dataset size for robustness. For extremely large object (or with a lot of object modes), you'll need to reduce batch_size to save GPU memory as well.\n",
    "    'SAVE_ITERS': 10,  # type: None or int. Number of completed iterations before saving the current reconstruction results (model, probe, object) and summary figures. If 'SAVE_ITERS' is 50, it'll create an output reconstruction folder and save the results and figures into it every 50 iterations. If None, the output reconstruction folder would not be created and no reconstruction results or summary figures would be saved. If 'SAVE_ITERS' > 'NITER', it'll create the output reconstruction folder but no results / figs would be saved. Typically we set 'SAVE_ITERS' to 50 for reconstruction mode with 'NITER' around 200 to 500. For hypertune mode, it's suggested to set 'SAVE_ITERS' to None and set 'collate_results' to true to save the disk space, while also provide an convenient way to check the hypertune performance by the collated results.\n",
    "    'update_step_size': 0.5, # type: float. Update step size, default is 0.5 but 0.1 is numerically more stable for multislice\n",
    "    'output_dir': 'output/paper/simu_tBL_WSe2/phonon_partial/', # type str. Path and name of the main output directory. Ideally the 'output_dir' keeps a series of reconstruction of the same materials system or project. The PtyRAD results and figs will be saved into a reconstruction-specific folder under 'output_dir'. The 'output_dir' folder will be automatically created if it doesn't exist.\n",
    "    'prefix_date': True, # type: boolean. Whether to prefix a date str to the reconstruction folder or not. Set to true to automatically prefix a date str like '20240903_' in front of the reconstruction folder name. Suggested value is true for both reconstruction and hypertune modes. In hypertune mode, the date string would be applied on the hypertune folder instead of the reconsstruction folder. \n",
    "    'prefix': '', # type: str. Prefix this string to the reconstruction folder name. Note that \"_\" will be automatically generated, and the attached str would be after the date str if 'prefix_date' is true.

'model' is the pytorch dict stored as hdf5 with '.pt' file extension. 'model' contains optimizable tensors and metadata so that you can always refine from it and load whatever optimizable tensors (object, probe, positions, tilts) if you want to continue the reconstruction. It's similar to the NiterXXX.mat from PtychoShelves. 'object' and 'probe' output the reconstructed object and probe as '.tif'. If you don't want to save anything, set 'SAVE_ITERS' to None. Suggested setting is to save everything (i.e., ['model', 'obja', 'objp', 'probe']).\n",
    "    'result_modes': {'obj_dim': [2, 3], 'FOV': ['crop'], 'bit': ['8']}, # type: dict. This dict specifies which object output is saved by their final dimension ('obj_dim'), whether to save the full or cropped FOV ('FOV') of object, and whether to save the raw or normalized bit depth version of object and probe. A comprehensive (but probably redundant) saving option looks like {'obj_dim': [2,3,4], 'FOV': ['full', 'crop'], 'bit': ['raw', '32', '16', '8']}. 'obj_dim' takes a list of int, the int ranges between 2 to 4, corresponding to 2D to 4D object output. Set 'obj_dim': [2] if you only want the zsum from multislice ptychography. Suggested value is [2,3,4] to save all possible output. 'FOV' takes a list of strings, the available strings are either 'full' or 'crop'. Suggested value is 'crop' so the lateral padded region of object is not saved. 'bit' takes a list of strings, the available strings are 'raw', '32', '16', and '8'. 'raw' is the original value range, while '32' normalizes the value from 0 to 1. '16' and '8' will normalize the value from 0 to 65535 and 255 correspondingly. Defualt is '8' to save only the normalized 8bit result for quick visualization. You can set it to ['raw', '8'] if you want to keep the original float32 bit results with normalized 8bit results. These postprocessing would postfix corresponding labels to the result files.\n",
