Usually 20-50 iterations can get 90% of the work done with a proper learning rate between 1e-3 to 1e-4. For faster trials in hypertune mode, set 'NITER' to a smaller number than your typical reconstruction to save time. Usually 10-20 iterations are enough for the hypertune parameters to show their relative performance. \n",

Number of diffraction patterns processed simultaneously to get the gradient update. \"Batch size\" is commonly used in machine learning community, while it's called \"grouping\" in PtychoShelves. Batch size has an effect on both convergence speed and final quality, usually smaller batch size leads to better final quality for iterative gradient descent, but smaller batch size would also lead to longer computation time per iteration because the GPU isn't as utilized as large batch sizes (due to less GPU parallelism). Generally batch size of 32 to 128 is used, although certain algorithms (like ePIE) would prefer a large batch size that is equal to the dataset size for robustness. For extremely large object (or with a lot of object modes), you'll need to reduce batch_size to save GPU memory as well.\n",

If null, the output reconstruction folder would not be created and no reconstruction results or summary figures would be saved. If 'SAVE_ITERS' > 'NITER', it'll create the output reconstruction folder but no results / figs would be saved. Typically we set 'SAVE_ITERS' to 50 for reconstruction mode with 'NITER' around 200 to 500. For hypertune mode, it's suggested to set 'SAVE_ITERS' to null and set 'collate_results' to true to save the disk space, while also provide an convenient way to check the hypertune performance by the collated results.\n",
