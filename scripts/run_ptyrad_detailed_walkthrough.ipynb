This removes some high frequency noise in the reconstructed object and make the apperance smoother. 'obj_type' can be either 'amplitude', 'phase', or 'both' with a specified 'std' and 'kernel_size' in unit of real-space px. Ideally kernel size is odd (like 5) and larger than 6std+1 so it decays to 0. This is usually not needed if your dataset contains sufficient dose and the kMax is not insanely high (extremely high kMax would gives very fine dx which makes feature appear sharper and probably more seemingly noisy)\n",
    "#     'obj_zblur'     : {'freq': None, 'obj_type': 'both', 'kernel_size': 5, 'std': 1}, # Apply a \"z-direction\" 1D Gaussian blur to the object. This is a real-space alternative to the typical kz_filter (or so called missing-wedge regularization that applies Fourier filtering to the object) designed for multislice ptychography. Similar to 'obj_rblur', 'obj_type' can be either 'amplitude', 'phase', or 'both' with a specified 'std' and 'kernel_size' in unit of real-space px. Note that the 'ptycho/engines/GPU_MS/private/regulation_multilayers.m' from PtychoShelves (fold_slice) is a combination of 'obja_thresh', 'kr_filter', and 'kz_filter', so you may want to activate all these constraints altogether in PtyRAD to get the most similar effect \n",
    "#     'kr_filter'     : {'freq': None, 'obj_type': 'both', 'radius': 0.15, 'width': 0.05}, # Apply a \"lateral\" Fourier low-pass filtering to the object. This is similar to the band-pass filter in Digital Micrograph that the k-space filter has a sigmoid-like profile, essentially a cut-off spatial frequency. Typically we're reconstucting object all the way to kMax (Nyquist frequency) so there's not much room for us to filter out hence it's recommended to keep this off unless you want to exclude certain spatial frequencies. 'radius' and 'width' are used to define the sigmoid funciton in relative unit with kMax. See 'utils/make_sigmoid_mask' for more details\n",
    "#     'kz_filter'     : {'freq': None, 'obj_type': 'both', 'beta': 0.1, 'alpha': 1}, # Apply the arctan kz filter just like the 'regulation_multilayers.m' in PtychoShelves. 'beta' controls the strength of the arctan function and is the same as 'eng. regularize_layers' in PtychoShelves. Typical value of 'beta' ranges from 0 to 1. 'alpha' is the implicit constant controls the lateral Fourier filtering that has similar effect as 'kr_filter', usually set as 1 to be consistent with PtychoShelves. Note that 'kz_filter' is designed to be a PtyRAD equivalence of the 'regulation_multilayers.m' so it also includes the arctan Fourier filer, lateral Fourier filter, and the soft object amplitude thresholding if you set 'obj_type' to 'both'. See 'optimization/kz_filter' for more details. While this 'kz_filter' works very well for most multislice reconstructions of crystals, you might prefer 'obj_zblur' if you have an object that has distinct top and bottom layer like twisted bilayer or tilted systems because 'kz_filter' would introduce intermixing between the top and bottom layer due to the periodic boundary condition of Fourier transform. Another solution to the intermixing is to pad vacuum layers to your object and remove them later, although padding extensive vacuum layers tend to make object phase bleed into the vacuum layers and it's very hard to set the interface\n",

The threshold is defined by 'thresh' and the value is determined by the min and max. Note that wave amplitude is multiplicative when propagating through multislice object, so even an objective amplitude of 0.95 can become 0.6 after 10 layers. The thresholding can be relaxed by the `relax` param that is a weighted sum betwen the pre-threshold and post-threshold values.\n",
    "#     'objp_postiv'   : {'freq': 1,    'relax': 0}, # Apply a positivity constraint of the object phase, make it non-negative. This clips the negative values (anything below 0) so the object is visually darker but with stronger constrast, it's suggested to keep it on so that you can interpret, compare, and process your object phase with a simple baseline. Besides, the positivity constraint makes it easier to compare with atomic potential ground truth after correct scaling for the scattering factor. The clipping can be relaxed by the `relax` param that is a weighted sum betwen the pre-threshold and post-threshold values.\n",

    "#     'NITER': 5, # type: int. Total number of reconstruction iterations. 1 iteration means a full pass of all selected diffraction patterns. Usually 20-50 iterations can get 90% of the work done with a proper learning rate between 1e-3 to 1e-4. For faster trials in hypertune mode, set 'NITER' to a smaller number than your typical reconstruction to save time. Usually 10-20 iterations are enough for the hypertune parameters to show their relative performance. \n",
    "#     'INDICES_MODE': {'mode': 'full', 'subscan_slow': None, 'subscan_fast': None}, # type: dict. Indices mode determines multiple ways to use diffraction patterns at each probe positions for reconstructions. Each probe position (or each diffraction pattern) has a unique index, by selecting a subset of the indices, we can conveniently change the effective reconstruction area ('center') or effective scan step size or real space overlap ('sub'). You may choose 'full' for reconstructing with all probe positions, 'sub' for subsampling by selecting only every few probe positions with the full FOV (i.e., this will increase the effective scan step size and is a good way to test whether we can reduce the real space overlap), or 'center' for only using the center rectangular region in real space with a effectively reduced FOV but full sized object canvas. 'subscan_slow' and 'subscan_fast' determine the number of scan positions chosen for 'sub' and 'center', and have no effect to 'full'. If 'subscan_slow' and 'subscan_fast' are not provided (or None), they'll be set to half of the 'N_scan_slow' and half of the 'N_scan_fast' by default. Typically we can start from 'INDICES_MODE': {'mode': 'sub', 'subscan_slow: None, 'subscan_fast': None} to get an quick idea of the entire object by reconstructing the entire object FOV but using only every other diffraction pattern along fast and slow scan directions (so only 1/4 diffraction patterns are used, hence 4x speedup in the iteration time). Similarly we can use 'center' to keep the effective scan step size, but reconstruct a smaller FOV. Once the 'sub' or 'center' show reasonable results, we can then switch to 'full' to further refine it without starting from scratch because there's no object dimension mismatch between the 'INDICES_MODEs'.\n",
    "#     'BATCH_SIZE': {'size': 32, 'grad_accumulation': 1}, # type: dict. Batch size is the number of diffraction patterns processed simultaneously to get the gradient update. 'size' is the number of diffraction pattern in a sub-batch, and 'grad_accumulation' is how many sub-batches' gradients are accumulated before applying the update. Effective batch size (for 1 update) is batch_size * grad_accumulation. Gradient accumulation is a ML technique that allows people to use large effective batch size by trading the iteration time with memory requirement, so if you can fit the entire batch inside your memory, you should always set 'grad_accumulation': 1 for performance. \"Batch size\" is commonly used in machine learning community, while it's called \"grouping\" in PtychoShelves. Batch size has an effect on both convergence speed and final quality, usually smaller batch size leads to better final quality for iterative gradient descent, but smaller batch size would also lead to longer computation time per iteration because the GPU isn't as utilized as large batch sizes (due to less GPU parallelism). On the other hand, large batch size is known to be more robust (noise-resilient) but converges slower. Generally batch size of 32 to 128 is used, although certain algorithms (like ePIE) would prefer a large batch size that is equal to the dataset size for robustness. For extremely large object (or with a lot of object modes), you'll need to reduce batch size to save GPU memory, or use `grad_accumulation` to split a batch into multiple sub-batches for 1 update.\n",
    "#     'GROUP_MODE': 'random',  # type: str. Group mode determines the spatial distribution of the selected probe positions within a batch (group), this is similar to the 'MLs' for 'sparse' and 'MLc' for 'compact' in PtychoShelves. Available options are 'random', 'sparse', and 'compact'. Usually 'random' is good enough with small batch sizes and is the suggested option for most cases. 'compact' is believed to provide best final quality, although it's converging much slower. 'sparse' gives the most uniform coverage on the object so converges the fastest, and is also preferred for reconstructions with few scan positions to prevent any locally biased update. However, 'sparse' for 256x256 scan could take more than 10 mins on CPU just to compute the grouping, hence PtychoShelves automatically switches to 'random' for Nscans > 1e3. The grouping in PtyRAD is fixed during optimization, but the order between each group is shuffled for every iteration.\n",
    "#     'SAVE_ITERS': 5,  # type: None or int. Number of completed iterations before saving the current reconstruction results (model, probe, object) and summary figures. If 'SAVE_ITERS' is 50, it'll create an output reconstruction folder and save the results and figures into it every 50 iterations. If None, the output reconstruction folder would not be created and no reconstruction results or summary figures would be saved. If 'SAVE_ITERS' > 'NITER', it'll create the output reconstruction folder but no results / figs would be saved. Typically we set 'SAVE_ITERS' to 50 for reconstruction mode with 'NITER' around 200 to 500. For hypertune mode, it's suggested to set 'SAVE_ITERS' to None and set 'collate_results' to true to save the disk space, while also provide an convenient way to check the hypertune performance by the collated results.\n",
    "#     'output_dir': 'output/tBL-WSe2/', # type str. Path and name of the main output directory. Ideally the 'output_dir' keeps a series of reconstruction of the same materials system or project.

    "#     'recon_dir_affixes': ['optimizer', 'start_iter', 'lr', 'model', 'constraint', 'loss'], # type: list of strings. This list specifies the optional affixes to the reconstruction folder name. The order of strings has NO effect to the output folder name. Available options are 'optimizer', 'start_iter', 'lr', 'model', 'constraint', 'loss', and 'init'. Note that the reconstruction folder should be distinct for each reconstruction run so the results don't get put into the wrong folder. 'optimizer' would affix the name of the PyTorch optimizer. 'start_iter' would affix the iteration at which optimizable variables start being updated by AD. 'lr' would affix the learning rate information. 'constrain', 'model' would affix the std from 'obj_preblur_std' and 'detector_blur_std' under 'model_params' if they're used. 'loss' would affix the activated loss term and their weights. 'init' would affix the initialization parameters like 'conv_angle', 'defocus', 'scan_affine', 'init_tilts' that could potentially be hypertuned. Note that all the affixes can be applied for both reconstruction and hypertune mode, it's just clearer to include 'init' if you're running hypertune mode that may optimize on some initial parameters.\n",
    "#     'prefix_date': True, # type: boolean. Whether to prefix a date str to the reconstruction folder or not. Set to true to automatically prefix a date str like '20240903_' in front of the reconstruction folder name. Suggested value is true for both reconstruction and hypertune modes.

    "#     'postfix': '', # type: str. Postfix this string to the reconstruction folder name. Note that \"_\" will be automatically generated. In hypertune mode, the postfix string would be applied on the hypertune folder instead of the reconsstruction folder.  \n",
    "#     'save_result': ['model', 'obja', 'objp', 'probe'], # type: list of strings. This list specifies the available results to save. Available options are 'model', 'obja', 'objp', and 'probe'. 'model' is the pytorch dict stored as hdf5 with '.pt' file extension. 'model' contains optimizable tensors and metadata so that you can always refine from it and load whatever optimizable tensors (object, probe, positions, tilts) if you want to continue the reconstruction. It's similar to the NiterXXX.mat from PtychoShelves. 'object' and 'probe' output the reconstructed object and probe as '.tif'. If you don't want to save anything, set 'SAVE_ITERS' to None. Suggested setting is to save everything (i.e., ['model', 'obja', 'objp', 'probe']). For hypertune mode, you can set 'collate_results' to true and set 'SAVE_ITERS' to None to disable result saving.\n",
    "#     'result_modes': {'obj_dim': [2, 3, 4], 'FOV': ['crop'], 'bit': ['raw', '8']}, # type: dict. This dict specifies which object output is saved by their final dimension ('obj_dim'), whether to save the full or cropped FOV ('FOV') of object, and whether to save the raw or normalized bit depth version of object and probe. A comprehensive (but probably redundant) saving option looks like {'obj_dim': [2,3,4], 'FOV': ['full', 'crop'], 'bit': ['raw', '32', '16', '8']}. 'obj_dim' takes a list of int, the int ranges between 2 to 4, corresponding to 2D to 4D object output. Set 'obj_dim': [2] if you only want the zsum from multislice ptychography. Suggested value is [2,3,4] to save all possible output. 'FOV' takes a list of strings, the available strings are either 'full' or 'crop'. Suggested value is 'crop' so the lateral padded region of object is not saved. 'bit' takes a list of strings, the available strings are 'raw', '32', '16', and '8'. 'raw' is the original value range, while '32' normalizes the value from 0 to 1. '16' and '8' will normalize the value from 0 to 65535 and 255 correspondingly. Defualt is '8' to save only the normalized 8bit result for quick visualization. You can set it to ['raw', '8'] if you want to keep the original float32 bit results with normalized 8bit results. These postprocessing would postfix corresponding labels to the result files.\n",
